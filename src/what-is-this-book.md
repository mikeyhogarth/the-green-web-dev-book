# What is this book?

This book aims to outline the relationship between web application development and climate change.

The main bulk of the text presents ideas and examples to help illustrate how we can contribute to reducing the energy cost of the applications we develop. It also explores some of the major themes that you might encounter when approaching this subject within your organisation and aims to address some of the questions you may have about sustainable web development.

The intended audience is anyone who is involved in the development of web applications. It is not necessary to read this book in chapter order.

## What is this book not?

It is also worth quickly pointing out what this book is **not**.

- This book assumes that you believe that **climate change is real** and makes no attempt to convince you of this fact. The climate crisis itself is only be mentioned very briefly.
- This book assumes you already have a working knowledge of web development, however I have attempted to make the text as accessible to all audiences as possible.
- This book is **not an exhaustive list** of everything you can do to create sustainable web applications.
- This book does not concern itself too much with the science of measuring energy usage. Whilst this is an important factor, there is plenty of research already out there which does a much better job of exploring this topic than I could.
