# What is this book?

The core aim of this book is to highlight the relationship between web application development and climate and to make this a key factor in technical decision-making.

The main bulk of the text presents ideas and examples to help illustrate how we can contribute to reducing the energy cost of the applications we develop. It also explores some of the major themes that you might encounter when approaching this subject within your organisation and aims to address some of the questions you may have about sustainable web development.

The intended audience for this book is anyone who is involved in the development of web applications - not only web developers but also peripheral roles such as content creators, delivery managers, product owners and scrum masters. It is not necessary to read this book in chapter order, neither is it necessary to read this whole book if you are only interested in a particular aspect of development - I'll quickly canter through the major themes that are covered.

* **General Tips** applicable to all aspects of web development.

* **Styles** and how they can be made more efficient.

* **Content and Markup** - the information that your applications deliver to users.

* **Frontend code** that runs on client machines - JavaScript or otherwise.

* **Backend code** that runs on your own pysical servers or in the cloud.

* **Images** - often the biggest offender in terms of a client's energy footprint and often where the lowest hanging fruit is in terms of optimising.

There is more to running sustainable web applications than just this, however these are what we focus on here - Appendix A provides references to some additional resources if you don't find what you're looking for in the above list.

## What is this book not?

It is also worth quickly pointing out what this book is **not**.

- This book assumes that you believe that **climate change is real** and makes no attempt to convince you of this fact. The climate crisis itself is only mentioned very briefly.
- This book assumes you already have a working knowledge of web development (although a *complete* working knowledge is not required if you are only interested in particular aspects). I have, however, attempted to make the text as accessible to all audiences as possible.
- This book is **not an exhaustive list** of everything you can do to create sustainable web applications. Here we mainly focus on some of the major themes involved in standing up web-based informaiton systems but it is possible to go a lot deeper on some of the  topics and also a lot wider in terms of scope. All we are trying to do here is raise awareness of the issue and give you some practical examples to inspire your own ideas.
- This book does not concern itself too much with the science of measuring energy usage. Whilst this is an important factor, there is plenty of research already out there which does a much better job of exploring this topic than I could. Some of these are referenced in Appendix A.
