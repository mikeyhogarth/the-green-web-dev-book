# Foreword

This is Bob. Bob drives an electric car. Bob uses his electric car responsibly:

- He switches the engine off when it's parked.
- He doesn't use it to drive to the newsagent, as this is only a 2 minute walk.
- Despite having a car, he uses public transport when he can.
- If he's driving to the same place as others, he offers those people a ride.

Nobody thinks Bob is weird for acting like this - these behaviors are unanimously considered to be normal, reasonable and sensible... in fact, if Bob _were_ to leave his engine on while he was parked, or if he _were_ to drive 10 seconds up the road to get a newspaper, people might say that Bob is a bit irresponsible. If he didn't offer lifts to people who were travelling to the same destination, well then they might say even worse things about him.

This book is about encouraging people to treat their web applications the way Bob treats his car.
