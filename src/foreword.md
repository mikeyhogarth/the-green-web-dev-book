# Foreword

Meet Bob. A few years ago, Bob decided to start driving an electric car to reduce his reliance on fossil fuels. Despite now running his vehicle entirely on renewable energy, Bob still takes steps to conserve energy.

* He switches the engine off when the vehicle is stationary.
* He doesn't drive very short distances.
* If he's traveling in the same direction as others, he will offer rides.

Nobody thinks Bob is weird for acting like this - in fact, these are the same behaviors that Bob has always practiced, even before deciding to switch to an electric vehicle. If Bob *were* to leave his engine on while parked, or if he *were* to drive twenty seconds up the road to get a newspaper, people might say that Bob is a bit irresponsible. If he didn't offer lifts to people who were traveling to the same destination as he was, well then they might say even worse things about him.

Conserving fuel is something that most car owners simply *accept* as being a good idea. Most are fully aware of the price of fuel and are familiar with the things that cause fuel to be consumed, with some more experienced drivers even being able to predict how much particulars journeys will cost. Fortunately for drivers, measuring and monitoring fuel consumption is very easy because the associated metrics are highly visible - the dashboard of a vehicle displays its current fuel level and almost all petrol stations advertise their fuel prices clearly in large illuminated letters on their forecourts (particularly frugal drivers watch these prices very closely).

The penchant for saving energy is not limited to car ownership - we all get electricity bills and we all know to turn things off when we're not using them. Money may be the main driver for our energy-usage behaviors, but there is something more primal going on here. In the back of our minds, the very notion of waste feels awful even if you put aside the associated monetory costs. Modern humans simply *hate* seeing things go to waste - renewable or otherwise.

So why then do we seldom apply this same principle when it comes to building software applications? Perhaps its because the impact is so much more difficult to measure or that the wastage is too abstract to comprehend - but in reality, the principle is exactly the same. This book aims to take our natural inclination to save energy and marry it to the domain of building web applications. It aims to show you that by prioritising sustainability, you can both save money and build much better software that your users will love.
