# Lazy load content

If possible, try to avoid loading content before it is meant to appear in the active viewport. This applies to content hidden behind a component, or located several page lengths outside the viewport.

## Common Solutions

- Pagination is a simple way to avoid loading hundreds of items on a single page.
- 'Infinite Scroll' is a popular solution, but beware of accessibility pitfalls associated with this kind of solution.
