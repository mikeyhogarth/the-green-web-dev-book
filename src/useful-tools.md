# Useful tools

A number useful tools available to help measure and optimise your applications.

* The people over at the [Green Web Foundation](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/) implemented a Javascript library called [CO2.js](https://github.com/thegreenwebfoundation/co2.js) which aims to provide an implementation of the 1-byte model for use in tools and APIs.

* [Sustainable Web Design](https://sustainablewebdesign.org/) (built by [MightyBytes](https://www.mightybytes.com/) and [Wholegrain Digital](https://www.wholegraindigital.com/)) have produced a couple of tools which can help you calculate a website's carbon footprint: The [Ecograder](https://ecograder.com/) scores websites based on a number of factors using a combination of external APIs. The [Website carbon calculator](https://www.websitecarbon.com/) can give you an estimate of your website's carbon footprint (including a [detailed explaination of how that estimate is calculated](https://www.websitecarbon.com/how-does-it-work/)).
