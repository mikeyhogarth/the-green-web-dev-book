# Don't overdo it!

It's great that you've decided to read about sustainable web development - really it is! I would actively encourage all developers to write sustainable applications, to use data responsibly and to not be wasteful with digital assets - these are all good things... however the intention is _not_ to make developers feel guilty over every single byte of data they use. You should not treat the ideas in this book as "the law" or as weapons to win arguments - they are simply small cues to help raise awareness and inspire positive change for your application development practices.

The impact of many of the ideas presented here are invisible to the naked eye whilst being extremely valuable under the hood... however some of them **do** have a noticable impact on things like image quality, brand identity and user experience. In some cases, the act of reducing the energy footprint of your application can actually have a _noticable_ and _negative_ impact on your users - and that presents you with a tradeoff. How exactly does one strike the balance between being sustainable and being feature-rich?

If you go into this all guns blazing, insisting that every single byte of data and every single CPU cycle must be preserved at all costs, you will not only lose the argument but you will also likely lose a lot of friends! Make sure all decisions are accompanied by a large dollop of common sense rather than always defaulting to what appears to be the sustainable option. It can happen that in choosing the most sustainable option, you erode the experience for your developers and users so much that the productivity hit ends up actually _increasing_ the amount of energy consumed by your application.

Many of the bigger pain points are related to **design**, an aspect where many tradeoffs can be made and their "vitalness" to the application is incredibly subjective. Being sustainable does _not_ necessarily mean that your application will be unattractive, but many common design trends do lean towards being quite energy-intensive whilst adding only non-functional features:

- Large, bold images
- Hero Banners
- Transitions and Animations

It is possible to take things too far in either direction. You could, for example, abandon CSS styles and sacrifice any custom look and feel for your site entirely - this will have a noticable _positive_ impact on your website's energy footprint but is also likely to _negatively_ impact conversions, giving your users the impression that your site is unprofessional or that it has encountered some kind of error. It won't, as they say, "pop" any more and this could seriously reduce customer engagement.

This is not about scrabbling about over every CPU cycle / bit of data or causing fights over sustainability - it is about striking a comfortable balance between your appliction's energy footprint and the value it is offering to users.
